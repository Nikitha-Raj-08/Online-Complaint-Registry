### Online Complaint Registration and Management System

The **Online Complaint Registration and Management System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of complaint submission, tracking, and resolution for users, agents, and administrators. The system provides a seamless experience for customers (ordinary users) to report issues, track complaint statuses, interact with agents, and manage personal profiles. 

The customer flow begins with user registration, allowing users to submit complaints with detailed descriptions, attachments, and contact information. They can monitor the status of their complaints and communicate with assigned agents for further clarification or updates. 

Agents are responsible for managing and resolving complaints assigned by administrators. They communicate with customers, update complaint statuses, and ensure timely resolution of issues. The system enables agents to monitor their workloads through a dashboard and handle customer inquiries directly.

For administrators, the platform offers comprehensive oversight, enabling them to manage users, assign complaints to agents based on expertise and workload, and enforce platform policies. Administrators also have the ability to monitor complaint progress, ensuring efficient and effective service delivery. Additionally, administrators can implement improvements to the platform, ensuring continuous enhancement in user experience, functionality, and security.

The system is designed to improve efficiency, enhance communication, and ensure a structured, transparent process for managing customer complaints.
